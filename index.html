                    <p class="lead">Reflexology, Crystal Healing, Access Bars, CPD Courses for Reflexologists and Animal Communication</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Val Winchester began her training in 1996 at the Maureen Burgess School of Reflexology at
                        Roehampton where she also qualified in Advanced Reflexology. Her interest in this therapy was
                        sparked when some family members had become ill and she had watched a nurse perform some massage
                        techniques which were helping tremendously.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Val then went on to study at the International College of Crystal Healing where she qualified as
                        a Crystal Therapist and learned meditation. Val has run Meditation Groups and workshops for many
                        years which she enjoys immensely.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As Val continued to see clients, she realised there was a further need in people as many of her
                        clients were going through stressful times and indeed trauma. This led to her taking a Diploma
                        in Spiritual Counselling and a Diploma in Hypnotherapy at the Holistic Healing College in London
                        and the London College of Hypnotherapy. Val also trained in Ireland with Doreen Virtue as an
                        Angel Therapy Practitioner and gives Angel Card Readings regularly.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        In March 2016 Val renewed her qualification in Reflexology for Fertility and now offers
                        Pregnancy Reflexology to offer the full complement of Reflexology treatments in pregnancy and
                        post-partum.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Val qualified as an Access Consciousness Bars Practitioner in July 2015 and then in January 2016
                        she qualified as an Access Bars Facilitator which allows Val to teach Bars classes. She has also
                        completed the Access Energetic Facelift, Access Body Processes and the Access Foundation course
                        as well which has given her more tools to work with during the Access Bars treatment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Val has a love of animals and has trained in Animal Communication and natural horsemanship
                        techniques.

                        <strong>Reflexology & Crystal Reflexology</strong>
                    </h2>
                    <p>Reflexology is based on the principle that there are reflex points on the feet and
                        hands and that by applying pressure to these points it can: 
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Relieve stress and tension</li>
                        <li>Stimulate circulation and rid the body of toxins</li>
                        <li>Bring the body into balance</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        It is a very relaxing treatment which involves a beautiful massage of the feet combined 
                        with pressure being applied to the reflex points in a way that is tailored to each 
                        individual.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When the use of crystals is combined with the Reflexology session, the whole treatment 
                        is enhanced considerably.  Many clients who find it difficult to relax or switch off, 
                        have found that they have a much deeper experience when the crystals are used.  </p>

                        <strong>Crystal Therapy</strong>
                    </h2>
                    <p>During a session of crystal therapy, crystals may be placed on the body, around the
                        body or under the couch. This is mostly a “hands off” therapy where healing energies
                        are then transmitted through the crystals. This is a very relaxing treatment and
                        balances the energy field of the Client.

                        <strong>Access Bars</strong>
                    </h2>
                    <h4>What is Access Bars?</h4>
                    <p>The Bars are a series of 32 points on the head, which when lightly touched release
                        old energies stuck in the brain and the body, allowing for tremendous and easy change.
                    </p>
                    <h4>What does an Access Bars session do?</h4>
                    <p>The Bars takes all the considerations, thoughts, feelings, emotions, decisions,
                        judgments, and beliefs from any lifetime, that are electrically stored in the brain
                        and releases them. This release occurs when the bars are touched; it allows that
                        stored junk to be released.

                            she has used it to help many horses, dogs and cats.  It can help with behavioural problems, 
                            anxiety and illness and pain in the animal's body. It can also help the animal to pass over 
                            when the time comes.</p>

                        "Meeting Val Winchester has changed my life. In March 2016, just after I launched my fitness
                        business, I met Val by chance and she offered me the opportunity to hire her yurt for my
                        Pilates classes. That was the start of a magical journey of self-discovery and life changing
                        events - my Pilates classes have grown, Val introduced me to Access Bars Consciousness and
                        facilitated my practitioner course in June 2016 and Val's amazing Mediation and Healing groups
                        has given me inner peace and calmness. I also highly recommend Val's Reflexology treatment,
                        which is not only a wonderful massage it also leaves you having a total body and mind connection."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Val's presence, healing energy, compassion, love and sense of humour leaves you feeling relaxed
                        and a total sense of being. Thank you Val for being in my life."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "I have known Valerie Winchester for at least 15 years and have found her meditation circles and 
                        other healing practices to be excellent.Valerie is a diligent and caring person in all that she does, 
                        always ready to help any who have questions, experiences etc.,    <br/>
                        Valerie is herself highly experienced in this field as I have attended many of her meditation groups 
                        where she has been professional in her conduct, knowing how to assist those with any issues that may 
                        arise and very discreet in her ability to do so.<br/>
                        I have no hesitation in recommending Valerie Winchester to run meditation courses and/or other healing 
                        practices she is so capable of." - D Summer</p>
                    <p>"I absolutely love Val's meditation groups! She manages to hold a relaxing, open and gentle space 
                        for everyone no matter what comes up. I've been attending Val's groups for many years and I swear 
                        by them as I always come away feeling clearer and energised." - Eleonora</p>
                    <p>"I've been going to Val's meditation group for quite some time.<br/>
                        What works for me is the gentleness and caring that I feel. I've been to quite a few other groups 
                        but never felt so looked after. I never want to miss it. She makes sure we are comfortable, the 
                        temperature is right, we have blankets, cushions if our feet don't touch the floor and water to drink.</br>
                        I like the quiet atmosphere that Val creates. There is some sharing, which is minimal, as the whole 
                        point for me is to sit and be with stillness. But it's good to hear ourselves speak our names and a 
                        brief where we are.<br/>
                        Every time we meet the meditations are different because of where I am and what's going on, So even 
                        if my mind has been having a field day I know my body has been resting. Sometimes I am in such a lovely 
                        peaceful place its a challenge to open my eyes and come back.<br/>
                        Val tunes in usually to see what the group needs and her meditation flows from that. It always seems 
                        more powerful in a group than sitting at home on my own.<br/>
                        Music is often used and can really help soothe and uplift<br/>
                        We pick an Angel card at the beginning which can help focus, sometimes we also pick a crystal to hold.<br/>
                        At the end we often have a message from another card which we share, that's really helpful too hearing 
                        all the card's messages.<br/>
                        Val is very particular about closing down and she introduces it so gently its like having another mini 
                        quiet time. It is something I often forget to do after leaving a group and sometimes when I am out I 
                        remember some of Val's words.<br/>
                        If Val is going to do another meditation group, let me know where!" - M Weatherall</p>
                        <p>"I have been taking part in Val's Meditation group for over ten years. Every session has a different 
                            theme using soothing music, crystals and / or Angel Cards. She leads us excellently into the 
                            meditations and guides us back, offering possible reasons for our individual experiences and allowing 
                            discussion within the group.<br/>
                        Val ensures we drink plenty of water and is always calm,caring and considerate towards each member of 
                        the group.<br/>
                        I have found an oasis from the hubbub of everyday life and take away a feeling tranquility each time I 
                        visit Val's meditation group .  I highly recommend her Meditation Sessions." - Sue Towersey</p>
